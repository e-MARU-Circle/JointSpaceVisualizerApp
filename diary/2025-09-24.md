# 2025-09-24

## Goals
- Introduce Git to the repository
- Start structured progress logging (diary and changelog)

## Work Done
- Added `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and seeded initial release notes
- Created `diary/README.md` and todayâ€™s entry to kick off usage

## Issues/Risks
- No Git history prior to this initialization

## Next Actions
- Regularly add daily entries under `diary/`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` per change batches/releases
- Consider adding `logging` to the app to persist runtime logs
